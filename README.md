## HTML Track - Dio.me

## Module 02 - HTML I - Basic Concepts

This challenge aims to create an "almost" complete website, with everything we've seen in this module. The topics to be covered are:

- Forms
- Text structuring and formatting
- Media
- Tables

As well as other resources discussed in class!

## Instructions

1. You must create a website for a medical clinic (you choose the specialty)
2. This site should contain the following navigation menu:
   - Home page
   - About the clinic
   - Opening hours
   - Contact
3. You must use all the subjects covered in class.

Below is how each page should be created and structured.

### Page structure

All pages must follow a predefined pattern. As we haven't learned about CSS yet, use the file `template.html` as a basis. It follows a structure similar to the image below.

\* \_There are some colors in the template, but it's just for better visualization. Feel free to change them as you see fit.

The **Menu** will contain the navigation menu (oh come on!), the **Header** of each page will contain an image, the **Footer** will contain contact information, and the **Content** is the content of each page.
